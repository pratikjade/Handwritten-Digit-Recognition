# SY_AI_A_5_Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition is the process of recognizing and interpreting handwritten digits from digit images of handwritten digits. It is a type of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) commonly used for data entry in automated systems, such as check processing and mail sorting.

In this particular implementation, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify handwritten digits. CNNs are particularly well suited for image classification tasks because they are able to extract features from images and learn to recognize patterns in the data. model architecture It consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layer is responsible for detecting features in the image, while the pooling layer reduces the dimensionality of the feature map and makes the model more robust to small Input image changes. The fully connected layer is responsible for combining the features extracted by the convolutional layer to make the final prediction.

The model was trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels. After the model is trained, it can be used to classify new images of handwritten digits and predict the written digits

This code defines a handwritten digit recognition model using the sequential API from the TensorFlow library. The model uses the MNIST dataset consisting of images of handwritten digits. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is commonly used in image classification task. The model has two convolutional layers (Conv2D) with 32 and 64 filters respectively, followed by a max pooling layer (MaxPool2D) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps. The activation function used in the convolutional layer is a rectified linear unit (ReLU) This is commonly used in CNNs.

The output of the convolutional layer is then flattened and passed through a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. The dropout layer randomly sets a specified proportion of input units to 0 during training. Then, the output of the dropout layer passes through a dense (fully connected) layer 10 units and a softmax activation function. The softmax function is typically used in the output layer of a classification model and returns the probability value for each class. The class with the highest probability is the model's prediction for the input image.

A graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library in Python. The GUI consists of a canvas where the user can draw handwritten numbers, a clear button to clear the canvas, and a predict button to predict the numbers drawn on the canvas. The code also imports and uses numpy tensorflow and pillow library. The model is loaded from a file named model.h5. When the user clicks the "Predict" button, the image on the canvas is captured and resized and processed to match the model's input format. The model then makes a prediction on the number and the result is displayed in the message Box.
